Write a very simple program, Scope and Header Files (see program 4-4 and 4-5).   The first file will have an include of a personal .h file, any external variables, its main function, and to call a function.   The second file would be a your personal .h file, have a constant variable SALESTAX initialized to 0.06625  ,   price_productA initialized to 12.25    ,   price_productB initialized to 20.75 .       The first program would print on new line the grand_total.  Call a function to take value of  price_productA then calculate total =  price_productA + ( price_productA *  SALESTAX), pass the total value back to the main, then in main add grand_total = grand_total + total.  In main print item, item cost, item total, grand total.
